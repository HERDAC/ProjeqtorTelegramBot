# ProjeQtOr Telegram Bot
This project is about a telegram bot I created to interact with [ProjeQtOr](https://www.projeqtor.org/en/), a quality based open-source project organizer.
The files available in this repository are all written by myself, with the exception of some snippets copied and modified from ProjeQtOr's source code.
This is a personal project but it is open-source (AGPL V3). If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to contact me.
The ideas for this bot are from my brother and myself, but feel free to send your own, though you should probably post them on [ProjeQtOr's forum](https://www.projeqtor.org/en/forum)
