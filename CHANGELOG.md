All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

(At the time this repo was created, the bot was already in V3.0, so there may be a lack of information or inaccuracy in what features were developped for previous versions)

   * When finished, click on "CrÃ©er" to show a summary of the ticket. You can either modify it again or confirm its creation

 * You can display elements from there reference
   > **This is intended for unique references, from V4.2+ there will be an option to choose from multiple elements with the same reference**
   * `/reference` -> asks for a reference and display information about the element
   * OR type `@BOT_NAME` and start writing a reference to be prompted with available references which you can select. When you click on one, it'll send the command `/reference selected-reference` which does the same as above

### Fixed
 * Responsible is now correctly set when a ticket template is used

## V4.1 - 2021-04-11
 
### Added
 * You can now attach files when creating a ticket
   * New button in the field selection menu
     * When you press "Ajouter", just send files to attach them. If you add a caption to the message containing the file, it will use this caption as its name. If you add a caption to a message containing multiple files, it will use this caption as the name for all the files. It may take a few seconds to add the files (rate limited to 1 file per second to avoid invalid data due to poor code structure, will be improved later)
     * If there are attachments, you can delete them by clicking on "Supprimer" and then selecting the ones you want to remove
   * Attachments are displayed on the ticket summary at the end of the creation process
